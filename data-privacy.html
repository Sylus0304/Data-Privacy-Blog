    <h1>Data Privacy for Perpetualite Students</h1>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173)</span> was enacted to protect individuals from unauthorized use of their personal information. As students, it's important to understand that our digital footprints are valuable, and this law ensures that companies or organizations collecting our data must adhere to strict standards. In the digital age, data is more valuable than ever, often referred to as the 'new oil' due to its significance in decision-making and business strategies.</p>

    <p>One of the key provisions is that organizations must ask for <span class="highlight">direct consent</span> before collecting any personal information. This means that they must explain why they need the data and how it will be used. If students aren't comfortable with how their data will be handled, they have the right to decline. More importantly, this law ensures that organizations are held accountable for protecting the data they collect.</p>

    <p>Data minimization is another crucial principle. This means that only necessary data should be collected and stored. Companies are not allowed to collect excessive data that they do not need for their services. For students, this principle protects you from becoming vulnerable to data breaches or misuse of your information.</p>

    <h2>What Students Should Know</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Always read privacy policies before sharing personal information.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of the data you share on social media platforms.</li>
        <li>Check the permissions you're granting to mobile apps.</li>
        <li>Request the deletion of personal information if no longer necessary.</li>
        <li>Understand your rights under the <span class="highlight">Data Privacy Act</span>, including the right to access, correct, and erase your personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The rise of social media, online learning, and cloud-based platforms has made data privacy a top concern for students. The more information you share online, the more you need to be vigilant about who has access to your data and how it is used. The <span class="highlight">Data Privacy Act of 2012</span> not only safeguards your information but also empowers you to take control of your online identity. Being aware of your data privacy rights is an essential skill in todayâ€™s tech-driven world.</p>
