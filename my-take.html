    <h1>Reflection on Data Privacy and Cybercrime</h1>
    <p>Attending the presentation on the <span class="highlight">Data Privacy </span> and learning about cybercrime in the Philippines was both informative and thought-provoking. As an BSCS student and a Fraud prevention agent for JPMC, I was aware of the importance of data security, but this event deepened my understanding of how critical it is. The fun parts like the Q&A session and the cash prize roulette at the end added an enjoyable twist, but I left with a lot of valuable insights about the modern digital world.</p>
    
    <p>One of the most striking points was how organizations must seek <span class="highlight">direct consent</span> before collecting personal information. This reminded me that companies need to get explicit permission before accessing sensitive data, which made me reflect on the personal information I have shared online. Knowing that the law gives me the right to control how my data is used gave me a sense of relief, especially in today’s online world where privacy is sometimes overlooked. I now understand how crucial it is to be vigilant in protecting not only my own data but also the data of others, especially when I step into the workforce.</p>

    <p>The speaker also shed light on <span class="highlight">data security</span> and how companies should treat it with the utmost seriousness. Ensuring data is kept safe from breaches and hacks isn't just a matter of compliance but a moral obligation. If a company is careless with personal data and there’s a breach, the <span class="highlight">National Privacy Commission (NPC)</span> steps in to ensure that the affected individuals are properly informed and protected. As an IT student, understanding these rules will guide my approach to handling sensitive information in my future career. It reminded me of the importance of practicing data minimization—keeping only the necessary data and ensuring its security through encryption and strong passwords.</p>

    <p>Learning about cybercrime was another eye-opener. The event delved into the various forms of cyber-attacks, such as phishing, ransomware, and identity theft, and it became clear how easy it is for hackers to exploit weaknesses in systems. The Philippines’ <span class="highlight">Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (RA 10175)</span> is there to combat these crimes, but awareness and prevention start with us. I learned how important it is to use multi-factor authentication and never to click on suspicious links or download attachments from untrusted sources. Staying proactive with security measures can make all the difference in a cybercrime-prone world.</p>

    <p>In addition, this event made me reflect on the evolving challenges faced by companies, especially now that remote work has increased the risk of security breaches. Protecting online data, monitoring systems for suspicious activity, and enforcing security policies are all crucial tasks that fall on both employees and organizations.</p>

    <p>The presentation not only taught me about the importance of protecting personal data but also gave me a broader view of the responsibility that companies, governments, and individuals share in securing sensitive information. With the rise of big data and the increasing digitization of daily activities, the need to be cyber-vigilant is greater than ever.</p>

    <p>Through this event, I feel more prepared to navigate the digital world and to apply what I have learned to real-life scenarios, both professionally and personally. I now see data privacy not just as a set of rules, but as a guiding principle to protect ourselves and others in this interconnected world.</p>
