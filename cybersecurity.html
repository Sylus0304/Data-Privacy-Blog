    <h1>Cybersecurity for Perpetualite Students</h1>
    <p>Cybersecurity involves protecting your online presence from threats such as hackers and malware. As a student, it’s essential to be aware of the risks associated with sharing personal information online. With the rise of digital learning and social media platforms, we often leave digital traces that can be exploited if not protected.</p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Install antivirus software on your devices and keep it updated.</li>
        <li>Don’t click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources.</li>
        <li>Use two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible for added security.</li>
        <li>Update your software regularly to patch security vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Back up your important files regularly to avoid data loss during cyberattacks.</li>
        <li>Be cautious of phishing scams. Always verify the sender before providing any personal information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters</h2>
    <p>The internet offers countless opportunities for learning and connecting with others, but it also exposes students to potential risks. The <span class="highlight">Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (RA 10175)</span> aims to combat cybercrimes like identity theft, hacking, and phishing. Staying informed about cybersecurity practices can help students protect themselves and others online. Every year, thousands of individuals fall victim to cyberattacks, and as students, we must take proactive measures to safeguard our digital identities.</p>

    <p>With the increasing use of mobile devices, personal computers, and online platforms, it's easy for hackers to exploit weak points in our online security. By implementing strong passwords, enabling 2FA, and being cautious with public Wi-Fi networks, you can minimize the risk of becoming a victim of cybercrimes.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, understanding cybersecurity is not just about protecting your data but also about ensuring that your digital footprint does not expose you to unnecessary risks. Be vigilant, stay informed, and always prioritize your online safety.</p>
